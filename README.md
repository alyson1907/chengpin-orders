This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
**Note:** If you're running the project on a WSL environment, access it through your WSL hostname IP instead. This is required in order to some requests work properly (e.g Image upload to Imgur)
